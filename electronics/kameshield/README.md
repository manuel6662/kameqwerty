# Attention:

This PCB is just a proof of concept of a shield for putting together the needed connectors for servos and battery on a NodeMCU V2. At this time, it has been fabricated an only one board (the one is actually being mounted on PoorKame) with a hobby-level milling machine, so I can't guarantee it to work or even if it is safe for being used with another specific hardware.
